# Microsemi_riscv_bootloader
PolarFire RISC-V Bootloader Designs

This folder contains several projects for the Eval, Splash and Everest boards to run a bootloader from SPI flash to memory.
The projects are self explanatory in their names as to what the target SPI flash device is used and what the target application
memory is.

From the branch menu above select the project you desire from the 10 listed and then download it together with the 4 files in the master view.

They are

UART_2_SCSPI_Bridge_eval2_ddr
